Configuring/Installing: 

to configure/install the program simply download and compile all .java files from the repository in a single folder which has no other files within it. Make sure you have cleared all previous versions of the program from that file directory before use. You must have the Java JDK installed on your PC to use this program

Operating the Program:
To use the program in its current state you must launch it from the command prompt console using the "java" command. Use "java" to launch the program from the file "EmployeeManagement" (do not include " symbols in the command or filename). 

To begin using the program you must input your full name. If you have already registered with the system you will be prompted to enter your password. Simply enter your password to access the main menu. If you do not have a registered account, you will be prompted to select a new password (use no spaces in this password) for the account. Choosing your password will register your new account. 

The main menu will display all "tool" options. Simply enter an option into the console to use it. "COUNT" will count the number of employees and print that number to the console. "ADD" will allow you to add new employee names to the list of employees by appending the names to your account file. "VIEW" allow you to view the list of all employee names.

To exit any tool simply enter "/back" when prompted for input within the tool. This will return you to the main menu. Once in the main menu entering "x" or "X" will exit the program.

Upon installation, assuming you have registered no new accounts you should have the following files
